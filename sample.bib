Unfortunately, the current candidates of atomic swaps (hash-lock time contracts) offer no privacy; the identities as well as the exact trade that happened between any two parties is publicly visible.",

However, swapping assets across chains, for example trading ethers for bitcoins is still a challenging problem to solve. Current solutions widely rely on trusted third parties such as exchanges, which is not acceptable for a distributed technology.Atomic Cross Chain Swap protocols that use hash time locked contract have been proposed as a solution for inter-chain exchanges but the atomicity of the transaction can be violated in case of client crash or packet loss. Furthermore those protocols are impractical as they require the user to perform complex audits and transactions on several blockchains over relatively long period of time.In this paper we propose to solve the shortcomings of hash time locked cross chain transaction by using relays and adapters in order to automate contract auditing and user actions as well as preventing atomicity violation.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 3rd Workshop on Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains for Distributed Systems}, pages = {59–64}, numpages = {6}, keywords = {atomic commitment, atomic swap, blockchain relays, blockchain interoperability}, location = {London, United Kingdom}, series = {CryBlock '20} }

  abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},
