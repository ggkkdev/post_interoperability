   This post is intended to present the minimal knowledge required for the understanding of how interoperability works and gives a quick overview of some current solutions. 
   
   We first present the background needed in blockchain technology with a focus on Merkle trees as they are mainly used in interoperability solutions. 
   
   We then define interoperability and explain how some interesting protocols are achieving it.
