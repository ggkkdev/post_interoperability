\begin{abstract}
   This post is intended to present the minimal understanding of how interoperability works and give a quick overview of some current solutions. For example, the details of the merkle trees in Ethereum are left in the appendix as it adds complexity and the post is hopefully understandable without it. \\
   We first present the background needed in blockchain with a focus on merkle trees as they are mainly used in interoperability solutions. 
   \\ We then define interoperability and explain how some interesting protocols are achieving it.
